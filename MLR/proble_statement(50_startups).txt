Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and
make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.

R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years
Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years
State -- states from which data is collected
Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years

==> R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years original data and predicted data.
==> R&d sales = mean square error = 85120931.33 
==> R&d sales = Root mean squar eerror  =  9226.1




==> Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
==>  Administration = mean square error =1527955397.74
==> Administration = Root mean square error = 39089.07






==> Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years Mean
==> squared error 701870011.2
==>  Root Mean squared error 26492.83



==> State -- states from which data is collected
==> Mean squared error 701870011.2
